# FastMultipole

[FastMultipole](https://github.com/byuflowlab/FastMultipole) is a highly performant, CPU parallelized fast multipole code suitable for accelerating large ``N``-body problems in scalar and or vector potentials with a wide range of applications, including astronomy, electro-magnetism, and fluid-dynamics. Typical use cases include boundary element problems, such as 3-dimensional panel methods. The code is compatible with [`ForwardDiff`](https://github.com/JuliaDiff/ForwardDiff.jl) and [`ReverseDiff`](https://github.com/JuliaDiff/ReverseDiff.jl) algorithmic differentiation for gradient-based design optimization. Its elegant interface makes it extremely easy to incorporate into existing Julia code with minimal modification. Convenience functions are provided for generating the expansions of source and vortex points and constant source and doublet panels, with more support planned for the future. It currently supports only the Laplace kernel, though this may change soon.
